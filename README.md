# What is This?

a bunch of programs and whatnot to test out this idea.


autos-spreadsheet.ods has at least 50 dealerships with markup that can be
parsed...


data.c - has all the URLs eventually
mm.c (should be renamed) - do requests for the dealer sites



the end goal is:
- write a program that can parse these pages and get what you want out of them
	(don't care what lang) 



# the rest of the plan

target 3 - 5 cities and come up with a set of dealers that you're pretty sure
will have what you're looking for.  dealer ratings may have to be shelved for
now b/c that will either require an api or a lot of legwork.

looking for a list of 2-300 dealers that fit the criteria (if each has at least
2 cars, then there are a total of 600 vehicles on the site - also most of them
really should specialize in low-end sales, so 300 x 10 = 3000 cars, good for
consumers to look through)
